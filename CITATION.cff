abstract: <p>Integrated Gradient Correlation (IGC) is a Python/PyTorch package that
  provides a unique dataset-wise attribution method.</p><p>It is designed to improve
  the interpretability of deep neural networks at a <i>task-level</i>, rather than
  an <i>instance-level</i> (as available attribution methods generally do). For more
  theoretical details, please refer to the original paper.</p>
